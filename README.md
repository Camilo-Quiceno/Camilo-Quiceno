# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

With 2 years of experience as a Software Developer and a Master's in Data Science, I specialize in backend development and building data-driven solutions. Currently, I work as a Backend Developer in the Data In Team at Talent.com, where I transform unstructured job listings into valuable, structured data, enhancing platform functionality and user experience.

Over the past year, I led the full migration of Talent.comâ€™s website from PHP to a modern microservices architecture using Go and TypeScript, deployed on Kubernetes and AWS. This migration not only improved scalability but also enabled the integration of AI-driven capabilities, setting the foundation for more dynamic and efficient platform performance. Additionally, I integrated real-time monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization.

Before joining Talent.com, I worked at Materialise, where I led the Plastic Design Team, focusing on quality assurance in the design of customized surgical guides, ensuring they met the highest standards of precision and functionality.
